<h3>

The rebellion bot is a custom bot that is made by <a href="https://awfixer.me">austin</a> the owner of the rebellion discord server
to do things that other bots cannot do, or do not do.

</div>

<justify>

The bot works on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/workers/">Cloudflare Workers</a>, and we plan on using databases like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mongodb">MongoDB</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-redis">Redis</a> hosted on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>
We have plans on offering AI and LLM Models to people who are paying for a premium version of the bot. There is also plans for the bot to be a middle mad
allowing us to manager pull requests, commits, issues, and discussions on platforms like Github and Gitlab using application commands on Discord

Feature Setup and Description


<div align="center">

<h3>
  Verification
</h3>

<p>
    Our Verification Module aims to be the first, and best of its kind. Allowing for a smooth onboarding experiance followed by a secure verification.
</p>

</div>

<details>

The way that verification works with this bot is very uniqe. It allows you to finish onboarding, picking the roles that you want. Then it snapshots what you picked and
proceeds to stip you of all the roles that you picked, replacing them with the unverified role. You can now only see the verify-here channel. When you complete verification
you are given the verified role, as well as all your previous roles back. This system is designed to work well with bots like Ko-Fi and Patreon, which assign roles that verification
does not usually account for when you join.

<h3>
    Moderation - User Based
</h3>

<p>
    Our User based Moderation is a system that will allow the users to filter out the bad actors in a way that is both politically correct and also protects them from retaliation
</p>

</div>

<details>

The way that this will work is like this, we have contect based message reporting commands that will allow users to report the entirity of a DM that is abusive, a scam, or anthing
else that is damaging to the user and or community. This context will allow our staff to understand the who what and why of what is going on, and respond appropraitely.
